## 简介

The GitOps Toolkit is the set of APIs and controllers that make up the
runtime for Flux v2. The APIs comprise Kubernetes custom resources,
which can be created and updated by a cluster user, or by other
automation tooling.

You can use the toolkit to extend Flux, and to build your own systems
for continuous delivery. The [the source-watcher
guide](../gitops-toolkit/source-watcher/) is a good place to start.
